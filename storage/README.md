      project_id: "my-project-123"
      region: "us-central1"
      storage_class: "STANDARD"
```

### Archive Storage for Long-term Backup
```yaml
buckets:
  backups:
    plugin: "gcp-storage-bucket"
    properties:
      project_id: "my-project-123"
      region: "us-central1"
      storage_class: "ARCHIVE"
```

### Nearline Storage for Monthly Reports
```yaml
buckets:
  reports:
    plugin: "gcp-storage-bucket"
